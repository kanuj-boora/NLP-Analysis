After escaping her court-ordered therapy session, Wednesday meets Tyler, who agrees to help her escape from Nevermore. However, she is apprehended by principal Larissa Weems and taken back to the school. Later, Tyler and Wednesday meet at the local fair, and Wednesday has a vision of Rowan’s death.

She sees a psychic vision of his bullies whom she attempts to kill in revenge but gets expelled. Her parents,\\xa0Morticia\\xa0and\\xa0Gomez, decide to enroll her in Nevermore Academy, a school for outcasts. Meanwhile, a hiker is killed by an unknown creature near Nevermore. Wednesday’s parents release\\xa0Thing, a sentient disembodied hand, to watch over her. She meets her roommate Enid, her complete opposite, and duels with Bianca, the popular girl, after she bullies another boy, Rowan. Later, Wednesday is nearly killed by a falling gargoyle but is saved by Bianca’s ex-boyfriend Xavier. After escaping her court-ordered therapy session, Wednesday meets Tyler, who agrees to help her escape from Nevermore. However, she is apprehended by principal Larissa Weems and taken back to the school. Later, Tyler and Wednesday meet at the local fair, and Wednesday has a vision of Rowan’s death. Rowan attempts to kill her but is murdered by the monster. * * * [jauntily macabre music playing] [student laughing] [heavy footfalls echoing] [girl] I’m not sure whose twisted idea it was to put hundreds of adolescents in underfunded schools run by people whose dreams were crushed years ago… but I admire the sadism.

[man sighs] Darling, how long do you intend on giving us the cold shoulder? Lurch, please remind my parents that I’m no longer speaking to them. [Lurch grunts] [woman] Hmm. I promise you, my little viper, you will love Nevermore. Won’t she, Tish? Of course. It’s the perfect school for her. Why? Because it was the perfect school for you? I have no interest in following in your footsteps. Becoming captain of the fencing team, Queen of the Dark Prom, President of the Séance Society. I merely meant that finally you will be among peers who understand you. Maybe you’ll even make some friends. Nevermore is like no other boarding school. It’s a magical place. It’s where I met your mother. And we fell in love. [yearning sigh] You guys are making me nauseous. Not in a good way. Darling, we aren’t the ones who got you expelled. That boy’s family was going to file attempted murder charges. How would that have looked on your record? Terrible. Everyone would know I failed to get the job done. Hmm. [man] Just over here is fine. Thanks. You sure you want to get out here? The trail might look pretty, but it runs right past Nevermore. That school for outcasts? Huh. That’s a polite way of putting it. I never had a problem with outcasts. My counselor at summer camp was a werewolf. Great guy. Yeah, they’re just like you and me, until they rip your throat out. [chuckles wryly] Thanks. [bird caws] [low, menacing music playing] [branches snapping] [ragged breathing] [creature snarls] [panicked screaming] [gate hinges creak] [ominous music builds] [sighs] At least it’s turning into a beautiful day. [bells tolling] [thunder rumbling] [playfully gloomy music playing] Wednesday is certainly a unique name. I’m guessing it was the day you were born? I was born on Friday the 13th. Her name comes from a line from my favorite nursery rhyme, “Wednesday’s child is full of woe.” You always had a unique perspective on the world, Morticia. Hmm. Did your mother tell you we were roommates back in the day? And you graduated with your sanity intact? Impressive. You’ve certainly had a very interesting educational journey. Eight schools in five years. They haven’t built one strong enough to hold me. I bet this place won’t be any different. What our daughter is trying to say is that she greatly appreciates the opportunity. Nevermore doesn’t usually accept students mid-term, but given Wednesday’s perfect grades and your family’s long history with the school, I’ve spoken with the board and we’ve made an exception. [quirky music playing] Larissa, what about Wednesday’s, um… therapy sessions? The court ordered them. Hmm. The school has a relationship with a therapist in Jericho. She can meet twice a week. Did you hear that, my little storm cloud? You’re in excellent hands. We’ll see if she survives the first session. I’ve assigned you to your mother’s old dorm. Ophelia Hall. [gasps, chuckles excitedly] [Wednesday] Refresh my memory. Ophelia’s the one who kills herself after being driven mad by her family, correct? Should we go meet your new roommate? [Morticia gasps] It’s so… vivid. [inhales excitedly] Howdy, roomie. Wednesday, this is Enid Sinclair. Are you feeling okay? You look a little pale. Wednesday always looks half-dead. Oh. Welcome to Ophelia Hall. Not a hugger. Got it. Please excuse Wednesday. She’s allergic to color. [Enid] Oh, wow. What happens to you? [flatly] I break out into hives and then the flesh peels off my bones. Luckily, we’ve special ordered you a uniform. [chuckles] Enid, please take Wednesday to the registrar’s office to pick it up along with her schedule, and give her a tour along the way. [ominous music playing] [haunting choral vocalizations] Nevermore was founded in 1791 to educate people like us. Outcasts, freaks, monsters, fill in your favorite marginalized group here. You can save the sanitized sales pitch. I don’t plan on staying here for long. Why not? This was my parents’ idea. Oh look, there’s my mother smirking at me. They’ve been looking for any excuse to send me here. It’s all a part of their nefarious, yet completely obvious plan. What plan? To turn me into a version of themselves. In that case, perhaps you can clear something up. Rumor’s been swirling around that you killed a kid at your old school, and your parents pulled strings to get you off. Actually, it was two kids, but who’s counting? Welcome to the quad. It’s a pentagon. The whole snarky Goth girl thing might have worked at normie school, but here things are different. Let me give you a wiki on Nevermore’s social scene. I’m not interested in participating in tribal adolescent clichés. Well, then use it to fill your obviously bottomless pit of disdain. There are many flavors of outcasts here, but the four main cliques are Fangs, Furs, Stoners and Scales. Those are the Fangs, AKA vampires. Some of them have literally been here for decades. That bunch of knuckleheads are Furs, AKA werewolves. Like me! [Furs howling] Full moons get pretty loud around here. That’s when Furs wolf out. I suggest you pick up noise-cancelling headphones. I’m assuming Scales are sirens? [Enid] You catch on quick. And that girl, Bianca Barclay, is the closest thing Nevermore has to royalty. [enchanting whooshing] Although her crown’s been slipping lately. She used to date our resident tortured artist, Xavier Thorpe. But they broke up at the beginning of the semester. Reason unknown. Fascinating. I know, right? My vlog is, like, the number one source for Nevermore gossip. Yo, Enid! You’re not gonna believe the dirt I heard about your new roommate. She eats human flesh. Chowed down on that kid she murdered. You better watch your back. Quite the contrary. I actually fillet the bodies of my victims, then feed them to my menagerie of pets. Ajax, this is my new roommate, Wednesday. Whoa. You’re in black and white. Like a living Instagram filter. Ignore him. Gorgons spend way too much time getting stoned. He’s cute, but clueless. It’s a small school. There wasn’t much online about you. You should really get on\\xa0Insta, Snapchat and TikTok. I find social media to be a soul-sucking void of meaningless affirmation. Look at you, my little deathtrap. Seeing you in this uniform brings back so many terrible memories. Doesn’t it, Tish? Yes. Why don’t you boys wait in the car? Wednesday and I need a moment. [Pugsley grunts] Pugsley, you’re soft and weak. You’ll never survive without me. I give you two months, tops. I’m gonna miss you, too, sis. Any plans you have of running away end right now. I’ve alerted all family members to contact me the minute you darken their doorstep. You have nowhere to go. As usual, you underestimate me, Mother. I will escape this educational penitentiary, and you will never hear from me again. [sighs] You are a brilliant girl, Wednesday, but sometimes you get in your own way. I’m sure you’ll grow to love Nevermore, and find it as life-changing as I did. Oh, I got you a little something. W… M. Our initials. It’s made of obsidian, which Aztec priests used to conjure visions. It’s a symbol of our connection. Which one of your spirits suggested this toe-curling tchotchke? I’m not you, Mother. I will never fall in love, or be a housewife, or have a family. I’m told girls your age say hurtful things, and I shouldn’t take it to heart. Fortunately, you don’t have one. Finally, a kind word for your mother. Lurch, the crystal ball, please. We can’t talk to you for the first week while you’re settling in, so we’ll call you next Sunday. [delicate, emotional music playing] [car door closes] Don’t worry, my love. Our little scorpion won’t be alone. [undercarriage clattering] [fingers scuttling] [thunder booms] Where’s the rest of him? Well, the torso and arm are over there. We found a leg by the lake. There’s an arm in that tree over there, and the rest of the parts are so far unaccounted for. It matches the profile of the other two attacks last week. All right, issue a warning. Keep hikers out of the woods. Don’t approve any more campfire permits for the foreseeable future. What do you want me to tell the press? You know they’re going to be swarming like mosquitos in July. Tell them the bear is back. You don’t believe that, Sheriff. No, I don’t. Whatever did this wasn’t human. Look, I know these murders are connected to Nevermore. I just can’t prove it yet. So until I can… it’s a goddamn bear. What the hell did you do to my room? Dividing our room equally. It looks like a rainbow vomited on your side. I… Silence would be appreciated. This is my writing time. Your writing time? I devote an hour a day to my novel. Perhaps if you did the same, your vlog might be coherent. I’ve read serial killer diaries with better punctuation. I write in my voice. It’s my truth. It’s what my followers love. Your followers are clearly imbeciles. They respond to your stories with insipid little pictures. Uh, you mean, emojis? It’s how people express their feelings. I realize that’s a foreign concept to you. When I look at you, the following emojis come to mind. Rope, shovel, hole. By the way, there are two D’s in Addams. If you’re going to gossip about me, at least spell my name correctly. [music player beeps, playing peppy pop song] Turn that off. This is your final warning. [playfully] Rawr! Don’t mess with me. This kitty’s got claws, and I’m not afraid to use them. [door opens] Good evening, girls. Oh, sorry about the mud. I wanted to make sure that Wednesday was settling in. Ah. Is this a bad time? I’m Ms. Thornhill, your dorm mom. Apologies, I wasn’t here to greet you when you arrived. I trust Enid has given you the old Nevermore welcome. She’s been smothering me with hospitality. I hope to return the favor. In her sleep. Well, here’s a little welcome gift from my conservatory. I try to match the right flower to each of my girls. When I read your personal statement in your application, I immediately thought of this one. The black dahlia. Oh, you know it? Of course. It’s named after my favorite unsolved murder. Thank you. Okey-dokey. Before I leave, I want to go over a few house rules. Lights off at 10:00, no loud music, and no boys, ever. What’s the story about going into the local town? Passes to Jericho are a privilege, not a right. It’s a brisk 25-minute walk, or there’s a shuttle on the weekends. The locals are a tad bit wary about Nevermore, so please don’t go making any waves, or perpetuating any outcast stereotypes. That means keep your claws to yourself, and no smothering people in their sleep. Are we clear? Great talk. [chuckles] [door opens] [foils clattering] [fencer grunts] [fencer grunts] Coach, Coach, she tripped me. It was a clean strike, Rowan. Maybe if you whined less and practiced more, you wouldn’t suck. Seriously, Coach, when am I gonna get real competition? Anyone else want to challenge me? I do. [ominous music playing] Oh, you must be the psychopath they let in. You must be the self-appointed Queen Bee. Interesting thing about bees. Pull out their stingers, they drop dead. [fencers] Ooh! Rowan doesn’t need you to come to his defense. He’s not helpless, he’s lazy. Are we doing this or not? En garde. [dramatic music playing] [both grunting] [coach] Point to Wednesday. [both continue grunting] [coach] The score is even. That first point was clearly beginner’s luck. Let’s finish this. For the final point, I would like to invoke a military challenge. No masks. No tips. [fencers] Ooh. Winner draws first blood. [dramatic musical flourish] It’s your decision, Bianca. Let’s see if you bleed in black and white. [dramatic music continues] [rapier tip slices] [disbelieving exhale] Your face finally got that splash of color it so desperately needed. [chuckles] [Rowan] You’re Wednesday, right? Rowan. I know how you feel. I guarantee you don’t. My mother promised me I’d finally fit in somewhere. I never thought it was possible to be an outcast in a school full of outcasts. But it looks like you’re gonna give me a run for my money. Uh… Sorry about the… nick. No good deed goes unpunished. [quirkily sinister music playing] [water tank gurgling] [chilling choir vocalizations] [stone scraping] [boy] Wednesday! Welcome back. Just take it easy. Nurse said you don’t have a concussion, but you probably have a nasty bump, huh? The last thing I remember I was walking outside feeling a mixture of rage, pity and self-disgust. I never felt that way before. Losing to Bianca has that effect on people, I think. Then I looked up and saw that gargoyle coming down and I thought, “At least I’ll have an imaginative death.” Then you tackled me out of the way. Why? [clicks tongue] Call it instinct. So you were guided by latent chivalry, the tool of the patriarchy, to extract my undying gratitude? Mm-hmm. Most people just say thank you. I didn’t want to be rescued. I shoulda just let that thing smash you to mush? I would have rather saved myself. [scoffs] Good to see you haven’t changed. If makes you feel any better, let’s just say I returned the favor. Xavier Thorpe? You probably don’t remember me. Last time we met, I was about two feet shorter, 40 pounds heavier. What happened? [exhales] Puberty, I guess. What happened the last time we met? Oh. Uh. Yeah, it… it was my godmother’s funeral. She was friends with your grandmother, and they spent their twenties in Europe, swindling the rich and notorious. I don’t know, but we were ten, and we were bored, decided to play hide and seek. I had the inspired idea to hide in her casket. I got stuck as it was headed to the crematorium. I’d heard muffled screams. I just figured your godmother had cheated death and was trying to claw her way out. Either way, you hit the big red stop button and saved me from being flame-broiled. So… now we’re even. [mournful rendition of “La Llorona” playing] [typewriter keys clacking] ♪ Ay de mí, Llorona ♪ ♪ Llorona, tú eres mi chunca ♪ [bed squeaking] ♪ Ay de mí, Llorona ♪ ♪ Llorona, tú eres mi chunca… ♪ I knew it! Hello, Thing. [bed frame rattling] Did you think my highly trained olfactory sense wouldn’t pick up on the faint whiff of neroli and bergamot in your favorite hand lotion? I could do this all day. [desk trembling] Surrender? [tapping frantically] Mother and Father sent you to spy on me, didn’t they? I’m not above breaking a few fingers. That they thought I wouldn’t find out proves how much they underestimate me. Oh, Thing, you poor, naive appendage. My parents aren’t worried about me. They’re evil puppeteers who want to pull my strings even from afar. The way I see it, you have two options. Option one. I lock you in here for the rest of the semester, and you go slowly insane trying to claw your way out, ruining your nails and your smooth, supple skin. And we both know how vain you are. Option two. You pledge your undying loyalty to me. ♪ …que no se apartan de mí… ♪ Our first order of business is to escape this teenage purgatory. [tapping] Of course I have a plan. And it begins now. [mysterious music playing] [indistinct chatter] [Weems] Dr. Kinbott’s office is on the second floor. Other Nevermore students swear by her. You’ll be here until I’m done? Perhaps afterwards we can visit the Weathervane for hot chocolate. Principal Weems, this feeble attempt at bonding is beneath you. And chauffeuring your students around is below your pay grade. Given your history, I’m sure you’re intent on running away. I’m here to prevent that from happening. I wish you luck. [door slams] I read the notes from your school counselor. Mrs. Bronstein. She had a nervous breakdown after our last session and had to take a six-month sabbatical. Go ahead and take a seat. How did you feel about that? Vindicated. But someone who crochets for a hobby isn’t a worthy adversary. Adversary? I hope we can forge a relationship based on trust and mutual respect. [scoffs] This is a safe space, Wednesday. A sanctuary where we can discuss anything. What you’re thinking, feeling, your views on the world, personal philosophy. That’s easy. I think that this is a waste of time. I see the world as a place that must be endured, and my personal philosophy is kill or be killed. So, for instance, when someone bullies your brother, your response is to dump piranha in the pool. You know the old saying, never bring a knife to a sword fight. Unless it’s concealed. Point is, you assaulted a boy, and showed no remorse for your actions. That’s why you’re here. He lost a testicle. I did the world a favor. People like Dalton shouldn’t procreate. I’ve answered all your questions. We’re not done yet. [mysterious notes play] Therapy is a valuable tool to help you understand yourself. It can teach you new ways to deal with your emotions. It can also help you build a life that you want. I know the life that I want. Tell me about it. Everything said in these sessions is strictly confidential. Do your plans involve becoming an author? I understand you’ve written three novels about a teen girl detective, Viper De La Muerte. Can you tell me about her? Viper is smart, perceptive, chronically misunderstood. Any luck getting your work published? Editors are short-sighted, fear-based life forms. One once described my writing as gratuitously morbid, and suggested I seek psychiatric help. [Kinbott] Hmm. Ironic, isn’t it? How did you take that? I sent her a “thank you.” [mischievous music playing] [screams] I’ve always been open to constructive criticism. I’m glad to hear that. Because I was sent the manuscripts as part of your psych evaluation. The relationship I found most intriguing was that of Viper and her mother, Dominica. Why don’t we dig into that? Part of this journey requires us going to uncomfortable places emotionally. I don’t travel well. Would you mind if I use the powder room first? [tense music builds, fades away] [lock clicks] [clattering] [Kinbott] Wednesday? Is everything okay? You can’t hide for the rest of the session. [Wednesday] I’m all right. Just preparing myself for our uncomfortable journey. Nail file. [dark electronic arrangement of theme music playing] On Saturday, I can do in the afternoon, sometime around four o’clock? [eerie whooshing] [cell phone rings] [ominous chanting] [chanting subsides] [farmer] Who let you out? You goddamn weirdo. [espresso machine whirs, hisses] Holy crap! Do you make a habit of scaring the hell out of people? It’s more of a hobby. You go to Nevermore. Didn’t realize they changed the uniform. I need a quad over ice. It’s an emergency. It’s four shots of espresso. Yeah, I… I know what a quad is, but, spoiler alert, the espresso machine’s having a seizure, so all we have is drip. But drip is for people who hate themselves and know their lives have no real purpose or meaning. What’s wrong with your machine? It’s a temperamental beast with a mind of its own, and it doesn’t help that the instructions are in Italian. I need a tri-wing screwdriver and a four-millimeter Allen wrench. Wait, you read Italian? Of course. It’s the native tongue of Machiavelli. Here’s the deal. I’m going to fix your coffee machine, then you’re going to make my coffee and call a taxi. Uh, no taxis in Jericho. Try Uber? I don’t have a phone. I refuse to be a slave to technology. Then you’re out of luck. Where you going anyway? That’s on a need-to-know basis. What about trains? Nearest station is Burlington. It’s half an hour away. You have a valve issue. I’ve seen it before. Where? You have one of these monsters at home? Steam-powered guillotine. I built it when I was ten. I wanted to decapitate my dolls more efficiently. Sure. Grim Reaper Barbie, makes perfect sense. [steam vents, subsides] Wow. Thanks. I never met a Nevermore kid who got their hands dirty. I’m Tyler, by the way. I didn’t catch your name, or is that on a need-to-know basis too? Wednesday. Tell you what, Wednesday. To show my appreciation, how about I drive you to Burlington? Perfect. Put that quad in a to-go cup. Uh, but I don’t get off for another hour. I’ll sweeten the pot. Twenty whole dollars… Tempting, but no. I’ll make it 40. Uh… Listen, Wednesday, one fun fact about me… I can’t be bought, so either wait, or find someone else to drive you. [melancholic string music playing] [exhales softly] [wry chuckle] What happened? Hey, boys, check it out. Who’s that? Bro… Come on. [boy 1] What’s a Nevermore freak doing out in the wild? [boy 2] This is our booth. Why are you dressed like religious fanatics? We’re pilgrims. Potato, po-tah-to. We work at Pilgrim World. It takes a special kind of stupid to devote an entire theme park to zealots responsible for mass genocide. My dad owns Pilgrim World. Who you\\xa0calling stupid? If the buckled shoe fits. Guys, back off. Stay out of this, Galpin. Yes, stay out of this. [sinister music playing] So tell me, freak… you ever been with a normie? I’ve never found one that could handle me. Boo! Hey! [boy grunts] [bone cracks] [boys grunting] [patrons chattering] [coughing] So where’d you learn those kung fu moves? [Wednesday] My uncle taught me. He spent five years in a Tibetan Monastery. Was he a monk? Prisoner. [Tyler] Dad! Tyler, the hell’s going on in here? They were harassing a customer, and she put them in their place. This little thing took down three boys? Did you help her? Dad, I swear, I wasn’t involved. [bullies groaning] Apologies, Sheriff. This one slipped away from me. Come on, Miss Addams, time to go. Wait a minute, hang on. You’re an Addams? Don’t tell me Gomez Addams is your father? That man belongs behind bars for murder. Guessin’ the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. I’m gonna keep my eye on you. Okay. [door opens, closes] Your first day and you’re already on Sheriff Galpin’s radar. Wish I could say I was surprised. What did he mean about my father? I have no idea, but a word of advice. Stop making enemies and start making a few friends. You’re going to need them. [Weems] Looks like an accident. I hope the driver’s okay. [ominous music playing] He’s dead. [siren wailing] Broke his neck. [police radio chatter] How can you tell from this angle? [tense, elegant cello music playing] [Wednesday playing “Paint It, Black”] [plucking out pizzicato rhythm] [shelf rumbling] [sweeping refrain builds] [cello continuing faintly in distance] [cello continuing faintly in distance] [sighs contentedly] [music swells, finishes] [exhales sharply] [tapping] No, I don’t really feel better. There’s just something wrong about this place. Not just because it’s a school. [door opens] How the hell did you get that oversized violin out the window? I had an extra hand. Whoa. Where’s the rest of him? It’s one of the great Addams family mysteries. [Furs howling, baying] Why aren’t you wolfing out? Because I can’t. It’s all I got. My mom says some wolves are late bloomers, but I’ve been to the best Lycanologist. I had to fly to Milwaukee, would you believe it? Yeah, she says there’s a chance I may never… you know. What happens then? I’d become a lone wolf. Sounds perfect. Are you kidding me? My life would be officially over. I’d be kicked out of my family pack with no prospect of finding a mate. I’m failing to see the problem here. I could die alone. We all die alone, Enid. You really suck at this. Cheering people up. [cries shakily] Why are you crying? Because I’m upset! Haven’t you ever cried, or are you above that too? It was the week after Halloween. I was six years old. I took my pet scorpion, Nero, out for his afternoon stroll, and we were ambushed. They wondered what kind of freak would have a scorpion for a pet. [boy] Yeah. Two of them held me down and made me watch… [bullies laughing] [gasps] [Nero squelching] …while the others ran Nero over until… [forlorn music playing] It was snowing when I buried what was left of him. I cried my little black heart out. But tears don’t fix anything. So I vowed to never do it again. [Furs continue baying] Your secret’s safe with me. Still think you’re weird as shit, though. The feeling is incredibly mutual. How would you like your single room back? You just need to show me how to use your computer. [rapid knocking] [suspenseful music building] Holy shit! [tapping] Okay. Okay, I’m taking orders from a hand. This isn’t weird at all. [ring tone trills] Uh… hi. That’s Thing. Is he, like, your pet? He’s sensitive. Look, I know Nevermore is ground zero for all things weird, but this is next-level. So, what happened to not wanting to be a slave to technology? Desperate times. Are you still willing to help me escape? After what happened today, I figured they’d have you in solitary. There’s the Harvest Festival this weekend. Attendance is mandatory. I’m going to use it as a cover. If you’re willing to drive me to the station, I can make it worth your while. I’m in. And no charge. Consider it a freebie. Why? ‘Cause I wish I was going with you. At least one of us will get out of this hellhole town. [crowd chatters, laughs] Are you sure you can trust that normie? Dad, I didn’t know they were gonna be here. I trust that I can handle myself. I don’t want you talking to her. I want you home by 12:00. 1:00. 12:30. [Enid] Well, good luck and safe travels. Still not a hugger. Got it. [tense music builds] [tense music trails off] Jeez, you get any better at this, you’ll be taking home a whole pack. Pandas don’t travel in packs. They prefer solitude. All right. Subtle hint taken. You should know I’m waiting for someone. Oh yeah, who’s the lucky guy… or girl? What does it matter to you? Didn’t mean to interrupt. You’re not. This is gonna be trickier than I thought. Dad hit me with a curfew. We need to go if I’m gonna make it back in time. I’ve got some dead weight I need to lose first. Meet me behind the parking lot when the fireworks start. You see that sad, lonely woman over there? She needs this pathetic validation more than I do. Would you mind distracting her? [panda] I love you.\\xa0I love you. [fireworks crackling] Hey, before you leave, I wanted you to have this. It’s your dad’s police file from when he was at Nevermore. I think it’s the reason my dad hates him. You okay? I’m not used to people engaging with me. Most see me coming and cross the street. You’re not scary. You’re just kinda… kooky. I prefer spooky. Oh. Now my train leaves in an hour. We’re burning moonlight. Uh, right, right. [low, menacing music playing] Hey. Come on, Wednesday. Wednesday! We can lose them in the crowd. Oh, whoa! [cryptic, high-pitched tones play] [caws] [wails] [flesh rending] Shit. Wednesday, we need to go. Wednesday, come on. Wednesday! Rowan, come back! Rowan, wait! What do you want? Why are you following me? I don’t have time to explain, but you’re in danger. [chuckles] I think you’ve got it backwards. [grunts] You’re the one who’s in danger. What are you doing? Saving everyone from you. [grunts] I have to kill you. The gargoyle, that was you? Yeah. It’s always the quiet ones. [ominous whooshing] [Rowan] Girl in the picture. That’s you. You want to kill me because of some picture? My mother drew that picture 25 years ago when she was a student at Nevermore. She was a powerful Seer. Told me about it before she died. Rowan, put me down. No! My mother said it was my destiny to stop this girl if she ever came to Nevermore, because she will destroy the school and everyone in it. [arcane power surges] [grunts] Rowan. Rowan. [tense, frenetic music playing] [bestial snarl] [screams] [bellows] [Rowan wails] [flesh rending] [raspy growling] Hello, my little black cloud. So tell us darling, how was your first week? [Wednesday] Let’s see. I narrowly avoided death twice, discovered that my father may be a murderer, learned that I could potentially destroy the school, and was mysteriously saved by a homicidal monster. As much as it pains me to admit, you were right, Mother. I think I’m going to love it here. [dramatic music swells] [narrator] This season on Wednesday… [Wednesday] This story’s about to take a dark turn. Luckily, I’m not afraid of the dark. There’s a monster out there, but everyone believes I made it all up. I need to find something that can prove I haven’t lost my mind. [Tyler] You’re really obsessed with this monster-in-the-woods thing. Would you rather I develop an obsession with horses and boy bands? So, tell us everything. [Wednesday] Since you’ve abandoned me, I’ve been hunted, haunted, and the target of an attempted murder. Ah, Nevermore, I love you so! [creature snarls, growls] How do you manage to end up at the center of every terrible thing that happens here? Incredible luck. [all screaming] [Wednesday] You insisted I go to this school. Did you really think I wouldn’t find out your secret? You don’t know the full story. When I suggested giving your side of the room a makeover, I did not have Ted Bundy’s Pinterest in mind. Ew. [Wednesday] This ends now. [dramatic music intensifies] If you hear me screaming bloody murder, there’s a good chance I’m just enjoying myself. [narrator] Watch all episodes now.

looks like a rainbow vomited on your side  I  Silence would be appreciated  This is my writing time  Your writing time  I devote an hour a day to my novel  Perhaps if you did the same  your vlog might be coherent  I ve read serial killer diaries with better punctuation  I write in my voice  It s my truth  It s what my followers love  Your followers are clearly imbeciles  They respond to your stories with insipid little pictures  Uh  you mean  emojis  It s how people express their feelings  I realize that s a foreign concept to you  When I look at you  the following emojis come to mind  Rope  shovel  hole  By the way  there are two D s in Addams  If you re going to gossip about me  at least spell my name correctly   music player beeps  playing peppy pop song  Turn that off  This is your final warning   playfully  Rawr  Don t mess with me  This kitty s got claws  and I m not afraid to use them   door opens  Good evening  girls  Oh  sorry about the mud  I wanted to make sure that Wednesday was settling in  Ah  Is this a bad time  I m Ms  Thornhill  your dorm mom  Apologies  I wasn t here to greet you when you arrived  I trust Enid has given you the old Nevermore welcome  She s been smothering me with hospitality  I hope to return the favor  In her sleep  Well  here s a little welcome gift from my conservatory  I try to match the right flower to each of my girls  When I read your personal statement in your application  I immediately thought of this one  The black dahlia  Oh  you know it  Of course  It s named after my favorite unsolved murder  Thank you  Okey dokey  Before I leave  I want to go over a few house rules  Lights off at        no loud music  and no boys  ever  What s the story about going into the local town  Passes to Jericho are a privilege  not a right  It s a brisk    minute walk  or there s a shuttle on the weekends  The locals are a tad bit wary about Nevermore  so please don t go making any waves  or perpetuating any outcast stereotypes  That means keep your claws to yourself  and no smothering people in their sleep  Are we clear  Great talk   chuckles   door opens   foils clattering   fencer grunts   fencer grunts  Coach  Coach  she tripped me  It was a clean strike  Rowan  Maybe if you whined less and practiced more  you wouldn t suck  Seriously  Coach  when am I gonna get real competition  Anyone else want to challenge me  I do   ominous music playing  Oh  you must be the psychopath they let in  You must be the self appointed Queen Bee  Interesting thing about bees  Pull out their stingers  they drop dead   fencers  Ooh  Rowan doesn t need you to come to his defense  He s not helpless  he s lazy  Are we doing this or not  En garde   dramatic music playing   both grunting   coach  Point to Wednesday   both continue grunting   coach  The score is even  That first point was clearly beginner s luck  Let s finish this  For the final point  I would like to invoke a military challenge  No masks  No tips   fencers  Ooh  Winner draws first blood   dramatic musical flourish  It s your decision  Bianca  Let s see if you bleed in black and white   dramatic music continues   rapier tip slices   disbelieving exhale  Your face finally got that splash of color it so desperately needed   chuckles   Rowan  You re Wednesday  right  Rowan  I know how you feel  I guarantee you don t  My mother promised me I d finally fit in somewhere  I never thought it was possible to be an outcast in a school full of outcasts  But it looks like you re gonna give me a run for my money  Uh  Sorry about the  nick  No good deed goes unpunished   quirkily sinister music playing   water tank gurgling   chilling choir vocalizations   stone scraping   boy  Wednesday  Welcome back  Just take it easy  Nurse said you don t have a concussion  but you probably have a nasty bump  huh  The last thing I remember I was walking outside feeling a mixture of rage  pity and self disgust  I never felt that way before  Losing to Bianca has that effect on people  I think  Then I looked up and saw that gargoyle coming down and I thought   At least I ll have an imaginative death   Then you tackled me out of the way  Why   clicks tongue  Call it instinct  So you were guided by latent chivalry  the tool of the patriarchy  to extract my undying gratitude  Mm hmm  Most people just say thank you  I didn t want to be rescued  I shoulda just let that thing smash you to mush  I would have rather saved myself   scoffs  Good to see you haven t changed  If makes you feel any better  let s just say I returned the favor  Xavier Thorpe  You probably don t remember me  Last time we met  I was about two feet shorter     pounds heavier  What happened   exhales  Puberty  I guess  What happened the last time we met  Oh  Uh  Yeah  it  it was my godmother s funeral  She was friends with your grandmother  and they spent their twenties in Europe  swindling the rich and notorious  I don t know  but we were ten  and we were bored  decided to play hide and seek  I had the inspired idea to hide in her casket  I got stuck as it was headed to the crematorium  I d heard muffled screams  I just figured your godmother had cheated death and was trying to claw her way out  Either way  you hit the big red stop button and saved me from being flame broiled  So  now we re even   mournful rendition of  La Llorona  playing   typewriter keys clacking    Ay de m   Llorona     Llorona  t  eres mi chunca    bed squeaking    Ay de m   Llorona     Llorona  t  eres mi chunca    I knew it  Hello  Thing   bed frame rattling  Did you think my highly trained olfactory sense wouldn t pick up on the faint whiff of neroli and bergamot in your favorite hand lotion  I could do this all day   desk trembling  Surrender   tapping frantically  Mother and Father sent you to spy on me  didn t they  I m not above breaking a few fingers  That they thought I wouldn t find out proves how much they underestimate me  Oh  Thing  you poor  naive appendage  My parents aren t worried about me  They re evil puppeteers who want to pull my strings even from afar  The way I see it  you have two options  Option one  I lock you in here for the rest of the semester  and you go slowly insane trying to claw your way out  ruining your nails and your smooth  supple skin  And we both know how vain you are  Option two  You pledge your undying loyalty to me     que no se apartan de m     Our first order of business is to escape this teenage purgatory   tapping  Of course I have a plan  And it begins now   mysterious music playing   indistinct chatter   Weems  Dr  Kinbott s office is on the second floor  Other Nevermore students swear by her  You ll be here until I m done  Perhaps afterwards we can visit the Weathervane for hot chocolate  Principal Weems  this feeble attempt at bonding is beneath you  And chauffeuring your students around is below your pay grade  Given your history  I m sure you re intent on running away  I m here to prevent that from happening  I wish you luck   door slams  I read the notes from your school counselor  Mrs  Bronstein  She had a nervous breakdown after our last session and had to take a six month sabbatical  Go ahead and take a seat  How did you feel about that  Vindicated  But someone who crochets for a hobby isn t a worthy adversary  Adversary  I hope we can forge a relationship based on trust and mutual respect   scoffs  This is a safe space  Wednesday  A sanctuary where we can discuss anything  What you re thinking  feeling  your views on the world  personal philosophy  That s easy  I think that this is a waste of time  I see the world as a place that must be endured  and my personal philosophy is kill or be killed  So  for instance  when someone bullies your brother  your response is to dump piranha in the pool  You know the old saying  never bring a knife to a sword fight  Unless it s concealed  Point is  you assaulted a boy  and showed no remorse for your actions  That s why you re here  He lost a testicle  I did the world a favor  People like Dalton shouldn t procreate  I ve answered all your questions  We re not done yet   mysterious notes play  Therapy is a valuable tool to help you understand yourself  It can teach you new ways to deal with your emotions  It can also help you build a life that you want  I know the life that I want  Tell me about it  Everything said in these sessions is strictly confidential  Do your plans involve becoming an author  I understand you ve written three novels about a teen girl detective  Viper De La Muerte  Can you tell me about her  Viper is smart  perceptive  chronically misunderstood  Any luck getting your work published  Editors are short sighted  fear based life forms  One once described my writing as gratuitously morbid  and suggested I seek psychiatric help   Kinbott  Hmm  Ironic  isn t it  How did you take that  I sent her a  thank you    mischievous music playing   screams  I ve always been open to constructive criticism  I m glad to hear that  Because I was sent the manuscripts as part of your psych evaluation  The relationship I found most intriguing was that of Viper and her mother  Dominica  Why don t we dig into that  Part of this journey requires us going to uncomfortable places emotionally  I don t travel well  Would you mind if I use the powder room first   tense music builds  fades away   lock clicks   clattering   Kinbott  Wednesday  Is everything okay  You can t hide for the rest of the session   Wednesday  I m all right  Just preparing myself for our uncomfortable journey  Nail file   dark electronic arrangement of theme music playing  On Saturday  I can do in the afternoon  sometime around four o clock   eerie whooshing   cell phone rings   ominous chanting   chanting subsides   farmer  Who let you out  You goddamn weirdo   espresso machine whirs  hisses  Holy crap  Do you make a habit of scaring the hell out of people  It s more of a hobby  You go to Nevermore  Didn t realize they changed the uniform  I need a quad over ice  It s an emergency  It s four shots of espresso  Yeah  I  I know what a quad is  but  spoiler alert  the espresso machine s having a seizure  so all we have is drip  But drip is for people who hate themselves and know their lives have no real purpose or meaning  What s wrong with your machine  It s a temperamental beast with a mind of its own  and it doesn t help that the instructions are in Italian  I need a tri wing screwdriver and a four millimeter Allen wrench  Wait  you read Italian  Of

He s dead   siren wailing  Broke his neck   police radio chatter  How can you tell from this angle   tense  elegant cello music playing   Wednesday playing  Paint It  Black    plucking out pizzicato rhythm   shelf rumbling   sweeping refrain builds   cello continuing faintly in distance   cello continuing faintly in distance   sighs contentedly   music swells  finishes   exhales sharply   tapping  No  I don t really feel better  There s just something wrong about this place  Not just because it s a school   door opens  How the hell did you get that oversized violin out the window  I had an extra hand  Whoa  Where s the rest of him  It s one of the great Addams family mysteries   Furs howling  baying  Why aren t you wolfing out  Because I can t  It s all I got  My mom says some wolves

after Halloween  I was six years old  I took my pet scorpion  Nero  out for his afternoon stroll  and we were ambushed  They wondered what kind of freak would have a scorpion for a pet   boy  Yeah  Two of them held me down and made me watch   bullies laughing   gasps   Nero squelching   while the others ran Nero over until   forlorn music playing  It was snowing when I buried what was left of him  I cried my little black heart out  But tears don t fix anything  So I vowed to never do it again   Furs continue baying  Your secret s safe with me  Still think you re weird as shit  though  The feeling is incredibly mutual  How would you like your single room back  You just need to show me how to use your computer   rapid knocking   suspenseful music building  Holy shit   tapping  Okay  Okay

the magic night     I softly say    both    A silent prayer     Like dreamers do     Then I fall asleep to dream     My dreams of you     I remember    bird chirps   birds thudding in time to music    That you said goodbye     feeble tweeting   both moaning   woman  Mmm   man sighs  Darling  how long do you intend on giving us the cold shoulder  Lurch  please remind my parents that I m no longer speaking to them   Lurch grunts   woman  Hmm  I promise you  my little viper  you will love Nevermore  Won t she  Tish  Of course  It s the perfect school for her  Why  Because it was the perfect school for you  I have no interest in following in your footsteps  Becoming captain of the fencing team  Queen of the Dark Prom  President of the S ance Society  I merely meant that finally you will be among peers who understand you  Maybe you ll even make some friends  Nevermore is like no other boarding school  It s a magical place  It s where I met your mother  And we fell in love   yearning sigh  You guys are making me nauseous  Not in a good way  Darling  we aren t the ones who got you expelled  That boy s family was going to file attempted murder charges  How would that have looked on your record  Terrible  Everyone would know I failed to get the job done  Hmm   man  Just over here is fine  Thanks  You sure you want to get out here  The trail might look pretty  but it runs right past Nevermore  That school for outcasts  Huh  That s a polite way of putting it  I never had a problem with outcasts  My counselor at summer camp was a werewolf  Great guy  Yeah  they re just like you and me  until they rip your throat out   chuckles wryly  Thanks   bird caws   low  menacing music playing   branches snapping   ragged breathing   creature snarls   panicked screaming   gate hinges creak   ominous music builds   sighs  At least it s turning into a beautiful day   bells tolling   thunder rumbling   playfully gloomy music playing  Wednesday is certainly a unique name  I m guessing it was the day you were born  I was born on Friday the   th  Her name comes from a line from my favorite nursery rhyme   Wednesday s child is full of woe   You always had a unique perspective on the world  Morticia  Hmm  Did your mother tell you we were roommates back in the day  And you graduated with your sanity intact  Impressive  You ve certainly had a very interesting educational journey  Eight schools in five years  They haven t built one strong enough to hold me  I bet this place won t be any different  What our daughter is trying to say is that she greatly appreciates the opportunity  Nevermore doesn t usually accept students mid term  but given Wednesday s perfect grades and your family s long history with the school  I ve spoken with the board and we ve made an exception   quirky music playing  Larissa  what about Wednesday s  um  therapy sessions  The court ordered them  Hmm  The school has a relationship with a therapist in Jericho  She can meet twice a week  Did you hear that  my little storm cloud  You re in excellent hands  We ll see if she survives the first session  I ve assigned you to your mother s old dorm  Ophelia Hall   gasps  chuckles excitedly   Wednesday  Refresh my memory  Ophelia s the one who kills herself after being driven mad by her family  correct  Should we go meet your new roommate   Morticia gasps  It s so  vivid   inhales excitedly  Howdy  roomie  Wednesday  this is Enid Sinclair  Are you feeling okay  You look a little pale  Wednesday always looks half dead  Oh  Welcome to Ophelia Hall  Not a hugger  Got it  Please excuse Wednesday  She s allergic to color   Enid  Oh  wow  What happens to you   flatly  I break out into hives and then the flesh peels off my bones  Luckily  we ve special ordered you a uniform   chuckles  Enid  please take Wednesday to the registrar s office to pick it up along with her schedule  and give her a tour along the way   ominous music playing   haunting choral vocalizations  Nevermore was founded in      to educate people like us  Outcasts  freaks  monsters  fill in your favorite marginalized group here  You can save the sanitized sales pitch  I don t plan on staying here for long  Why not  This was my parents  idea  Oh look  there s my mother smirking at me  They ve been looking for any excuse to send me here  It s all a part of their nefarious  yet completely obvious plan  What plan  To turn me into a version of themselves  In that case  perhaps you can clear something up  Rumor s been swirling around that you killed a kid at your old school  and your parents pulled strings to get you off  Actually  it was two kids  but who s counting  Welcome to the quad  It s a pentagon  The whole snarky Goth girl thing might have worked at normie school  but here things are different  Let me give you a wiki on Nevermore s social scene  I m not interested in participating in tribal adolescent clich s  Well  then use it to fill your obviously bottomless pit of disdain  There are many flavors of outcasts here  but the four main cliques are Fangs  Furs  Stoners and Scales  Those are the Fangs  AKA vampires  Some of them have literally been here for decades  That bunch of knuckleheads are Furs  AKA werewolves  Like me   Furs howling  Full moons get pretty loud around here  That s when Furs wolf out  I suggest you pick up noise cancelling headphones  I m assuming Scales are sirens   Enid  You catch on quick  And that girl  Bianca Barclay  is the closest thing Nevermore has to royalty   enchanting whooshing  Although her crown s been slipping lately  She used to date our resident tortured artist  Xavier Thorpe  But they broke up at the beginning of the semester  Reason unknown  Fascinating  I know  right  My vlog is  like  the number one source for Nevermore gossip  Yo  Enid  You re not gonna believe the dirt I heard about your new roommate  She eats human flesh  Chowed down on that kid she murdered  You better watch your back  Quite the contrary  I actually fillet the bodies of my victims  then feed them to my menagerie of pets  Ajax  this is my new roommate  Wednesday  Whoa  You re in black and white  Like a living Instagram filter  Ignore him  Gorgons spend way too much time getting stoned  He s cute  but clueless  It s a small school  There wasn t much online about you  You should really get on Insta  Snapchat and TikTok  I find social media to be a soul sucking void of meaningless affirmation  Look at you  my little deathtrap  Seeing you in this uniform brings back so many terrible memories  Doesn t it  Tish  Yes  Why don t you boys wait in the car  Wednesday and I need a moment   Pugsley grunts  Pugsley  you re soft and weak  You ll never survive without me  I give you two months  tops  I m gonna miss you  too  sis  Any plans you have of running away end right now  I ve alerted all family members to contact me the minute you darken their doorstep  You have nowhere to go  As usual  you underestimate me  Mother  I will escape this educational penitentiary  and you will never hear from me again   sighs  You are a brilliant girl  Wednesday  but sometimes you get in your own way  I m sure you ll grow to love Nevermore  and find it as life changing as I did  Oh  I got you a little something  W  M  Our initials  It s made of obsidian  which Aztec priests used to conjure visions  It s a symbol of our connection  Which one of your spirits suggested this toe curling tchotchke  I m not you  Mother  I will never fall in love  or be a housewife  or have a family  I m told girls your age say hurtful things  and I shouldn t take it to heart  Fortunately  you don t have one  Finally  a kind word for your mother  Lurch  the crystal ball  please  We can t talk to you for the first week while you re settling in  so we ll call you next Sunday   delicate  emotional music playing   car door closes  Don t worry  my love  Our little scorpion won t be alone   undercarriage clattering   fingers scuttling   thunder booms  Where s the rest of him  Well  the torso and arm are over there  We found a leg by the lake  There s an arm in that tree over there  and the rest of the parts are so far unaccounted for  It matches the profile of the other two attacks last week  All right  issue a warning  Keep hikers out of the woods  Don t approve any more campfire permits for the foreseeable future  What do you want me to tell the press  You know they re going to be swarming like mosquitos in July  Tell them the bear is back  You don t believe that  Sheriff  No  I don t  Whatever did this wasn t human  Look  I know these murders are connected to Nevermore  I just can t prove it yet  So until I can  it s a goddamn bear  What the hell did you do to my room  Dividing our room equally  It looks like a rainbow vomited on your side  I  Silence would be appreciated  This is my writing time  Your writing time  I devote an hour a day to my novel  Perhaps if you did the same  your vlog might be coherent  I ve read serial killer diaries with better punctuation  I write in my voice  It s my truth  It s what my followers love  Your followers are clearly imbeciles  They respond to your stories with insipid little pictures  Uh  you mean  emojis  It s how people express their feelings  I realize that s a foreign concept to you  When I look at you  the following emojis come to mind  Rope  shovel  hole  By the way  there are two D s in Addams  If you re going to gossip about me  at least spell my name correctly   music player beeps  playing peppy pop song  Turn that off  This is your final warning   playfully  Rawr  Don t mess with me  This kitty s got claws  and I m not afraid to use them   door opens  Good evening  girls  Oh  sorry about the mud  I wanted to make sure that Wednesday was settling in  Ah  Is this a bad time  I m Ms  Thornhill  your dorm mom  Apologies  I wasn t here to greet you when you arrived  I trust Enid has given you the old Nevermore welcome  She s been smothering me with hospitality  I hope to return the favor  In her sleep  Well  here s a little welcome gift from my conservatory  I try to match the right flower to each of my girls  When I read your personal statement in your application  I immediately thought of this one  The black dahlia  Oh  you know it  Of course  It s named after my favorite unsolved murder  Thank you  Okey dokey  Before I leave  I want to go over a few house rules  Lights off at        no loud music  and no boys  ever  What s the story about going into the local town  Passes to Jericho are a privilege  not a right  It s a brisk    minute walk  or there s a shuttle on the weekends  The locals are a tad bit wary about Nevermore  so please don t go making any waves  or perpetuating any outcast stereotypes  That means keep your claws to yourself  and no smothering people in their sleep  Are we clear  Great talk   chuckles   door opens   foils clattering   fencer grunts   fencer grunts  Coach  Coach  she tripped me  It was a clean strike  Rowan  Maybe if you whined less and practiced more  you wouldn t suck  Seriously  Coach  when am I gonna get real competition  Anyone else want to challenge me  I do   ominous music playing  Oh  you must be the psychopath they let in  You must be the self appointed Queen Bee  Interesting thing about bees  Pull out their stingers  they drop dead   fencers  Ooh  Rowan doesn t need you to come to his defense  He s not helpless  he s lazy  Are we doing this or not  En garde   dramatic music playing   both grunting   coach  Point to Wednesday   both continue grunting   coach  The score is even  That first point was clearly beginner s luck  Let s finish this  For the final point  I would like to invoke a military challenge  No masks  No tips   fencers  Ooh  Winner draws first blood   dramatic musical flourish  It s your decision  Bianca  Let s see if you bleed in black and white   dramatic music continues   rapier tip slices   disbelieving exhale  Your face finally got that splash of color it so desperately needed   chuckles   Rowan  You re Wednesday  right  Rowan  I know how you feel  I guarantee you don t  My mother promised me I d finally fit in somewhere  I never thought it was possible to be an outcast in a school full of outcasts  But it looks like you re gonna give me a run for my money  Uh  Sorry about the  nick  No good deed goes unpunished   quirkily sinister music playing   water tank gurgling   chilling choir vocalizations   stone scraping   boy  Wednesday  Welcome back  Just take it easy  Nurse said you don t have a concussion  but you probably have a nasty bump  huh  The last thing I remember I was walking outside feeling a mixture of rage  pity and self disgust  I never felt that way before  Losing to Bianca has that effect on people  I think  Then I looked up and saw that gargoyle coming down and I thought   At least I ll have an imaginative death   Then you tackled me out of the way  Why   clicks tongue  Call it instinct  So you were guided by latent chivalry  the tool of the patriarchy  to extract my undying gratitude  Mm hmm  Most people just say thank you  I didn t want to be rescued  I shoulda just let that thing smash you to mush  I would have rather saved myself   scoffs  Good to see you haven t changed  If makes you feel any better  let s just say I returned the favor  Xavier Thorpe  You probably don t remember me  Last time we met  I was about two feet shorter     pounds heavier  What happened   exhales  Puberty  I guess  What happened the last time we met  Oh  Uh  Yeah  it  it was my godmother s funeral  She was friends with your grandmother  and they spent their twenties in Europe  swindling the rich and notorious  I don t know  but we were ten  and we were bored  decided to play hide and seek  I had the inspired idea to hide in her casket  I got stuck as it was headed to the crematorium  I d heard muffled screams  I just figured your godmother had cheated death and was trying to claw her way out  Either way  you hit the big red stop button and saved me from being flame broiled  So  now we re even   mournful rendition of  La Llorona  playing   typewriter keys clacking    Ay de m   Llorona     Llorona  t  eres mi chunca    bed squeaking    Ay de m   Llorona     Llorona  t  eres mi chunca    I knew it  Hello  Thing   bed frame rattling  Did you think my highly trained olfactory sense wouldn t pick up on the faint whiff of neroli and bergamot in your favorite hand lotion  I could do this all day   desk trembling  Surrender   tapping frantically  Mother and Father sent you to spy on me  didn t they  I m not above breaking a few fingers  That they thought I wouldn t find out proves how much they underestimate me  Oh  Thing  you poor  naive appendage  My parents aren t worried about me  They re evil puppeteers who want to pull my strings even from afar  The way I see it  you have two options  Option one  I lock you in here for the rest of the semester  and you go slowly insane trying to claw your way out  ruining your nails and your smooth  supple skin  And we both know how vain you are  Option two  You pledge your undying loyalty to me     que no se apartan de m     Our first order of business is to escape this teenage purgatory   tapping  Of course I have a plan  And it begins now   mysterious music playing   indistinct chatter   Weems  Dr  Kinbott s office is on the second floor  Other Nevermore students swear by her  You ll be here until I m done  Perhaps afterwards we can visit the Weathervane for hot chocolate  Principal Weems  this feeble attempt at bonding is beneath you  And chauffeuring your students around is below your pay grade  Given your history  I m sure you re intent on running away  I m here to prevent that from happening  I wish you luck   door slams  I read the notes from your school counselor  Mrs  Bronstein  She had a nervous breakdown after our last session and had to take a six month sabbatical  Go ahead and take a seat  How did you feel about that  Vindicated  But someone who crochets for a hobby isn t a worthy adversary  Adversary  I hope we can forge a relationship based on trust and mutual respect   scoffs  This is a safe space  Wednesday  A sanctuary where we can discuss anything  What you re thinking  feeling  your views on the world  personal philosophy  That s easy  I think that this is a waste of time  I see the world as a place that must be endured  and my personal philosophy is kill or be killed  So  for instance  when someone bullies your brother  your response is to dump piranha in the pool  You know the old saying  never bring a knife to a sword fight  Unless it s concealed  Point is  you assaulted a boy  and showed no remorse for your actions  That s why you re here  He lost a testicle  I did the world a favor  People like Dalton shouldn t procreate  I ve answered all your questions  We re not done yet   mysterious notes play  Therapy is a valuable tool to help you understand yourself  It can teach you new ways to deal with your emotions  It can also help you build a life that you want  I know the life that I want  Tell me about it  Everything said in these sessions is strictly confidential  Do your plans involve becoming an author  I understand you ve written three novels about a teen girl detective  Viper De La Muerte  Can you tell me about her  Viper is smart  perceptive  chronically misunderstood  Any luck getting your work published  Editors are short sighted  fear based life forms  One once described my writing as gratuitously morbid  and suggested I seek psychiatric help   Kinbott  Hmm  Ironic  isn t it  How did you take that  I sent her a  thank you    mischievous music playing   screams  I ve always been open to constructive criticism  I m glad to hear that  Because I was sent the manuscripts as part of your psych evaluation  The relationship I found most intriguing was that of Viper and her mother  Dominica  Why don t we dig into that  Part of this journey requires us going to uncomfortable places emotionally  I don t travel well  Would you mind if I use the powder room first   tense music builds  fades away   lock clicks   clattering   Kinbott  Wednesday  Is everything okay  You can t hide for the rest of the session   Wednesday  I m all right  Just preparing myself for our uncomfortable journey  Nail file   dark electronic arrangement of theme music playing  On Saturday  I can do in the afternoon  sometime around four o clock   eerie whooshing   cell phone rings   ominous chanting   chanting subsides   farmer  Who let you out  You goddamn weirdo   espresso machine whirs  hisses  Holy crap  Do you make a habit of scaring the hell out of people  It s more of a hobby  You go to Nevermore  Didn t realize they changed the uniform  I need a quad over ice  It s an emergency  It s four shots of espresso  Yeah  I  I know what a quad is  but  spoiler alert  the espresso machine s having a seizure  so all we have is drip  But drip is for people who hate themselves and know their lives have no real purpose or meaning  What s wrong with your machine  It s a temperamental beast with a mind of its own  and it doesn t help that the instructions are in Italian  I need a tri wing screwdriver and a four millimeter Allen wrench  Wait  you read Italian  Of course  It s the native tongue of Machiavelli  Here s the deal  I m going to fix your coffee machine  then you re going to make my coffee and call a taxi  Uh  no taxis in Jericho  Try Uber  I don t

another hour  I ll sweeten the pot  Twenty whole dollars  Tempting  but no  I ll make it     Uh  Listen  Wednesday  one fun fact about me  I can t be bought  so either wait  or find someone else to drive you   melancholic string music playing   exhales softly   wry chuckle  What happened  Hey  boys  check it out  Who s that  Bro  Come on   boy    What s a Nevermore freak doing out in the wild

He s dead   siren wailing  Broke his neck   police radio chatter  How can you tell from this angle   tense  elegant cello music playing   Wednesday playing  Paint It  Black    plucking out pizzicato rhythm   shelf rumbling   sweeping refrain builds   cello continuing faintly in distance   cello continuing faintly in distance   sighs contentedly   music swells  finishes   exhales sharply   tapping  No  I don t really feel better  There s just something wrong about this place  Not just because it s a school   door opens  How the hell did you get that oversized violin out the window  I had an

after Halloween  I was six years old  I took my pet scorpion  Nero  out for his afternoon stroll  and we were ambushed  They wondered what kind of freak would have a scorpion for a pet   boy  Yeah  Two of them held me down and made me watch   bullies laughing   gasps   Nero squelching   while the others ran Nero over until   forlorn music playing  It was snowing when I buried what was left of him  I cried my little black heart out  But tears don t fix anything  So I vowed to never do it again   Furs continue baying  Your secret s safe with me  Still think you re weird as shit  though  The
